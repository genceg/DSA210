# The Impact of the development of a country on Happiness

## **Project Overview**
This project explores the relationship between the **development of a country** and **happiness scores** across countries. The HDI consists of three key components:  
- **Life Expectancy at Birth** (Health)  
- **Expected Years of Schooling** (Education)  
- **Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita** (Economic Well-being)  

By analyzing these factors, we aim to determine whether countries with higher scores in these categories tend to have higher happiness levels.

## **Hypothesis**
- **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ):** HDI factors (Life Expectancy, Education, and GNI per Capita) do not significantly influence happiness scores.  
- **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ):** HDI factors (Life Expectancy, Education, and GNI per Capita) have a significant positive relationship with happiness scores.

## **Datasets**
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **World Happiness Report Dataset**  
üìå **Source:** [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/data/)  
- Contains **happiness scores** of countries along with related indicators.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Human Development Index (HDI) Dataset**  
üìå **Source:** [UNDP HDI Data](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index)  
- Measures human development through:  
  - **Life Expectancy at Birth**  
  - **Expected Years of Schooling**  
  - **Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita**
  - 
### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Hypothesis Testing**
- Test hypotheses like:
**H‚ÇÄ**: HDI factors (Life Expectancy, Education, and GNI per Capita) do not significantly influence happiness scores.  
**H‚ÇÅ**: HDI factors (Life Expectancy, Education, and GNI per Capita) have a significant positive relationship with happiness scores.
- **Regression Model** ‚Üí Fit a **multiple linear regression** model to predict happiness scores based on HDI factors.  

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Visualization**
- **Scatter plots** ‚Üí Show HDI components vs. happiness scores.  
- **Box plots** ‚Üí Compare happiness levels across HDI quartiles.  
- **World heatmaps** ‚Üí Display variations in HDI and happiness across countries.
